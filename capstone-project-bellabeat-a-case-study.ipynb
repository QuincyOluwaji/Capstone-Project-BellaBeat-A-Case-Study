It designs smart devices that informs and inspires women around the world. By collecting data on activity, sleep, stress, and reproductive health, Bellabeat has empowered women with knowledge about their own health and habits. Since it was founded in 2013, Bellabeat has grown rapidly and quickly positioned itself as a tech-driven wellness company for women.\nUrška Sršen, Bellabeat’s cofounder and Chief Creative Officer has asked to  focus on a Bellabeat product and analyze smart device usage data in order to gain insight into how people are already using their smart devices. Then, using this information, she would like high-level recommendations for how these trends can inform Bellabeat marketing strategy.\n\n**PHASE 1: ASK**\n\nWHAT IS THE BUSINESS TASK?\nI have been tasked with the job of analysing a smart device data of  non bellabeat devices, apply insights gained on a bellabeat product then, use the insights to bellabeat marketing team’s strategy. So in one sentence the business task is: Identify trends in usage of non Bellabeat devices and apply the insight on a bellabeat product to grow the marketing strategy.\n\nWHO ARE THE KEY STAKEHOLDERS:\nUrška Sršen: Bellabeat’s cofounder and Chief Creative Officer \nSando Mur: Mathematician and Bellabeat’s cofounder; key member of the Bellabeat executive team \nBellabeat marketing analytics team: A team of data analysts responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting data that helps guide Bellabeat’s marketing strategy. \n\n**PHASE 2: PREPARE**\n\nDATASET SOURCE:\nThe dataset I will be using is the FitBit Fitness Tracker Data. It is a public data made available by Mobius. It is a Kaggle dataset which contains personal fitness tracker from thirty fitbit users. Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. It includes information about daily activity, steps, and heart rate that can be used to explore users’ habits. This dataset was generated by respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 03.12.2016-05.12.2016. It contains 18 csv files and it is in a long format.\nIS THE DATA ROCCC?\nA good data set must be ROCCC meaning it must be reliable, Original,Comprehensive,Current and Cited.\nReliable – This dataset is not reliable because it has a sample size of 30 respondent, this is too small to be a true representation of fitness app users. It also only accounts for two months of data. This is too low and makes the data biased.\nOriginality – The data set is not original as it was distributed by a third party Amazon Mechanical Turk.\nComprehensive – The data set is not comprehensive enough as it does not not provide data such as the age, health condition  etc of the respondents.\nCurrent – The data set is not current as it dates back to 2016 and contains no recent data so it would not contain current trend in smart device usages.\nCited – We have little information about the credibility of the source.\nAll these makes the data set unreliable and uncredible. Further analysis with more recent and reliable data needs to be done to make reliable recommendations.\n\nSORT AND FILTER DATA;\nAfter going through the data on excel spreadsheet, I have selected the dailyAcivity_Merged.csv file, sleepDay_merged.csv and hourly_steps.csv because I want to find the trends in the usage of the app without focusing too much on detailed performance of the users. These data I belive will show interesting patterns.\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**PHASE 3: PROCESS**\n\nTOOLS USED;\nI observed the data on Excel then did the analysis and visualization on R\n\nINSTALLING PACKAGES: \nI loaded the following libraries to use for my analysis\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"library(tidyverse)\nlibrary(here)\nlibrary(skimr)\nlibrary(janitor)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(lubridate)\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(sqldf)\nlibrary(RColorBrewer)\nlibrary(dplyr)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-06-09T14:44:28.399972Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-06-09T14:44:28.402148Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-06-09T14:44:30.340611Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**IMPORTING DATA:**\n\nNext I imported the data i will be making use of which is the following:\n\n*  Daily Activity\n*  Sleep Day\n*  Hourly Steps\n\n**CLEANING AND FORMATTING DATA**\n\nI used the str() function to check the data types of the data and all were accurate except data which was in character instead of datetime\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"daily_activity <- read.csv(\"../input/fitbit/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/dailyActivity_merged.csv\")\nsleep_day <- read.csv(\"../input/fitbit/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/sleepDay_merged.csv\")\nhourly_steps <- read.csv(\"../input/fitbit/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/hourlySteps_merged.csv\")\nstr(daily_activity)\nstr(sleep_day)\nstr(hourly_steps)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-06-09T14:44:30.343498Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-06-09T14:44:30.401348Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-06-09T14:44:30.550661Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"I renamed the date columns and formatted it using as.date()","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"daily_activity <- daily_activity %>%\n  rename(date = ActivityDate) %>%\n  mutate(date = as_date(date, format = \"%m/%d/%Y\"))\nstr(daily_activity)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-06-09T14:44:30.554881Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-06-09T14:44:30.556761Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-06-09T14:44:30.657036Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"sleep_day <- sleep_day %>%\n  rename(date = SleepDay) %>%\n  mutate(date = as_date(date,format =\"%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p\" , tz=Sys.timezone()))\nstr(sleep_day)\n\n","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-06-09T14:44:30.661159Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-06-09T14:44:30.663048Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-06-09T14:44:30.702444Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"hourly_steps<- hourly_steps %>% \n  rename(date_time = ActivityHour) %>% \n  mutate(date_time = as.POSIXct(date_time,format =\"%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p\" , tz=Sys.timezone()))\nstr(hourly_steps)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-06-09T14:44:30.706767Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-06-09T14:44:30.708779Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-06-09T14:44:30.780043Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"i checked for the total number of distinct users","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"### checking for total number of respondent\nsqldf(\"select distinct id\n      from daily_activity\")\n\nsqldf(\"select distinct id\n      from sleep_day\")\n\nsqldf(\"select distinct id\n    from hourly_steps\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-06-09T14:44:30.784031Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-06-09T14:44:30.785794Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-06-09T14:44:31.595022Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"i checked to see if there are any duplicate rows.

This would encourage users to wear their devices for longer period.\n\n2) Bellabeat could make their devices more interactive for users. From the analysis, the users dont get the recommeded minutes of sleep in a day. Bellabeat could create features that allows users schedule sleep/nap time and make recommendations when they dont sleep for enough minutes.\n\n3) Bellabeat could make tasks and reward for users. They could create daily or weekly chalenges which alows users to achieve requiered amout of steps and sleep then reward users for completion of the tasks. \n\n4) They could also send notifications to remind them prior to them time their activities are to start and check in when the users can not complete their activities/tasks.\n\n5) Bellabeat could give their devices more fancy designs.\n\n6) Bellabeat could recommend simple work out exercises for users","metadata":{}}]}
